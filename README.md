We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting.
Before submitting a pull request, please make sure your code is formatted by:
1. add .prettierrc.json file
2. commands used:
```
   npx prettier --check .
   npx prettier --write .
   npm run format
```

Standards:
```
// .prettierrc.json
{
    "semi": true,
    "singleQuote": false,
    "tabWidth": 4,
    "trailingComma": "es5",
    "printWidth": 80,
    "bracketSpacing": true
}
```

When working on a new task, create a new branch and commit changes to that branch as you progress. When a task is done, push your code and make a merge request to keep everyone else updated on the app progress. Additionally, communicate the progress to the rest of the group.
